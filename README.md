# This is a simple Discord bot to ping a role/user when a message is sent in a specified channel.

1. Set your Discord token in pinger.py on line 7.

2. Set the Discord Role ID, for the role you want to ping, in pinger.py on line 32.  This can easily be changed to a user or @everyone what ever works for you.

3. Put the channel ID's of the channel(s) you want to monitor in channelID.txt.
